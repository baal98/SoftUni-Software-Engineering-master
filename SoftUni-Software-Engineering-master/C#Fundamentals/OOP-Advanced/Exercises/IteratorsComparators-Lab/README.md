# <p align="center"> Lab:  Iterators and Comparators </p>

Problems for exercises and homework for the [&quot;C# OOP Advanced&quot; course @ Software University](https://softuni.bg/courses/java-oop-advanced).You can check your solutions here: [https://judge.softuni.bg/Contests/707/Iterators-and-Comparators-Lab](https://judge.softuni.bg/Contests/707/Iterators-and-Comparators-Lab)

## 1.Library

Create a class **Book** which should have three public properties:

- **string Title**
- **int Year**
- **List&lt;string&gt; Authors**

Authors can be **anonymous, one or many**. A Book should have only **one** **constructor**.

Create a class **Library** which should store a collection of books and implement the **IEnumerable&lt;Book&gt;** interface.

- **List&lt;Book&gt; books**

A Library should be could be intilized without books or with any number of books and should have only **one**** constructor**.

### Examples

```csharp
 public static void Main()
 {
     Book bookOne = new Book("Animal Farm", 2003, "George Orwell");
     Book bookTwo = new Book("The Documents in the Case", 2002, "Dorothy Sayers", "Robert Eustace");
     Book bookThree = new Book("The Documents in the Case", 1930);

     Library libraryOne = new Library();
     Library libraryTwo = new Library(bookOne, bookTwo, bookThree); 
 }
```
## 2.Library Iterator

Extend your solution from the prevoius task. Inside the Library class create a **nested class** **LibraryIterator** which should implement the **IEnumerator&lt;Book&gt;** interface. Try to implement the bodies of the inherited methods by yourself. You will need two more members:

- **List&lt;Book&gt; books**
- **int currentIndex**

Now you should be able to iterate through a Library in the Main method.

### Examples

Startup.cs

```csharp
 public static void Main()
 {
     Book bookOne = new Book("Animal Farm", 2003, "George Orwell");
     Book bookTwo = new Book("The Documents in the Case", 2002, "Dorothy Sayers", "Robert Eustace");
     Book bookThree = new Book("The Documents in the Case", 1930);

     Library libraryOne = new Library();
     Library libraryTwo = new Library(bookOne, bookTwo, bookThree); 

     foreach (var book in libraryFull)
     {
         Console.WriteLine(book.Title);
     }
 }
```
| **Output** |
| --- |
| Animal Farm <br/> The Documents in the Case <br/> The Documents in the Case |

## 3.Comparable Book

Extend your solution from the prevoius task. Implement the **IComparable&lt;Book&gt;** interface in the existing class **Book**. The comparison between two books should happen in the following order:

- First sort them in **ascending**  **chronological** order (by year)
- If two books are published in the **same year** , sort them **alphabetically**

Override the **ToString()** method in your Book class so it returns a string in the format:

- { **title** } - { **year** }

Change your Library class so that it stores the books in the correct order.

You don&#39;t need to change anything in your **Main** method from the previous task except for the way to print a book on the Console.

### Examples

| **Output** |
| --- |
| The Documents in the Case - 1930 <br/> The Documents in the Case - 2002 <br/> Animal Farm - 2003 |


## 4.Book Comparator

Extend your solution from the prevoius task. Create a class **BookComparator** which should implement the **IComparer&lt;Book&gt;** interface and thus include the following method:

- **int Compare(Book, Book)**

**BookComparator** must **compare** two books by:

1. Book title - **alphabetical order**
2. Year of publishing a book - **from the newest to the oldest**

Modify your Library class once again to implement the **new sorting**.

### Examples

```csharp
 public static void Main()
 {
     Book bookOne = new Book("Animal Farm", 2003, "George Orwell");
     Book bookTwo = new Book("The Documents in the Case", 2002, "Dorothy Sayers", "Robert Eustace");
     Book bookThree = new Book("The Documents in the Case", 1930);

     

 }
```

| **Output** |
| --- |
| Animal Farm - 2003 <br/> The Documents in the Case - 2002 <br/> The Documents in the Case - 1930 |
